The goal is to work on two tasks:

2. Second task is to create a site where you try out for example eight of the css properties listed [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference)

The website should consist in displaying all the colors of a rainbow by also adding a blue (sky blue) as the background of the page.
